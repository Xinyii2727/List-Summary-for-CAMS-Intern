# List-Summary-for-CAMS-Intern
Based on a list of people who asked questions this week and last week, I want to find list of people who didn't ask questions this week and their cumulative weeks for not asking till now. It's for improving summary task for my internship, an interesting try.

1st version at 2020.10.14
Need to Improve:
1. '冯志刚', we don't record his quesitioning until he gives the first question
2. Input might be more incise, and if someone input something worng, he doesn't need to inpur from the beginning
3. Package it(I'm not sure if it's necessary, but sounds interesting)
